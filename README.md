## Required Functionality

The following **required** functionality is complete:

- [-] Game interface has a heading (h1 tag), a line of body text (p tag), and four buttons that match the demo app
- [-] "Start" button toggles between "Start" and "Stop" when clicked.
- [-] Game buttons each light up and play a sound when clicked.
- [-] Computer plays back sequence of clues including sound and visual cue for each button
- [-] Play progresses to the next turn (the user gets the next step in the pattern) after a correct guess.
- [-] User wins the game after guessing a complete pattern
- [-] User loses the game after an incorrect guess

The following **optional** features are implemented:

- [-] Any HTML page elements (including game buttons) has been styled differently than in the tutorial
- [-] Buttons use a pitch (frequency) other than the ones in the tutorial
- [ ] More than 4 functional game buttons
- [-] Playback speeds up on each turn
- [-] Computer picks a different pattern each time the game is played
- [-] Player only loses after 3 mistakes (instead of on the first mistake)
- [ ] Game button appearance change goes beyond color (e.g. add an image)
- [ ] Game button sound is more complex than a single tone (e.g. an audio file, a chord, a sequence of multiple tones)
- [ ] User has a limited amount of time to enter their guess on each turn

The following **additional** features are implemented:

- [ ] List anything else that you can get done to improve the app!
- added links & a styled UI that looks more "game-friendly"

2. What was a challenge you encountered in creating this submission (be specific)? How did you overcome it? (recommended 200 - 400 words)
   
   A few challenges I encountered when creating this submission included trying to understand the Javascript for the music implementations as well as attempting to create a website that looked somewhat professional. I think my main issue with the javascript was actually just attempting to figure out what was going on. For example, there were some audio-specific calls that I came to understand called part of the audio-processing API. To aid my understanding of this, I had to write a little pseudo-code for the javascript for methods and other calls to the API that I was not initially understanding. I suppose the drive to understand it a little better was mainly because I still wanted to be able to feel like I had created something even with the step-by-step instructions. 
   
   I also felt like I really wanted to make something that looked both unique and fit my personality as I was the one creating it. Initially, I just jumped right into coding and made the basic functionality and figured I would think up a design on the spot. I ended up with something that looked vaguely like the demo but I felt like the design was much too elementary. For example, I wanted the design to look simple without looking unintentionally so. A major issue I had was actually just with text because I felt like a serif font might be a little bit over the top, yet a san-serif font like Arial made the already bare website look hacked together. I figured the best way to go about this was to think up a theme (I went with muted-green colors as the sounds of the game seemed to fit that mood) and draw out my plan or wireframe for the website design and then search on Google or StackOverflow for how to go about implementing the design. After knowing what I wanted and how to search for it, I was able to design the website exactly how I intended, such as by adding fonts from Google's open source fonts, adding color, and even adding some interactivity with the hover.
